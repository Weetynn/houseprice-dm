# Analysis of King County Housing Data and Data Warehousing Principles

#### (PART I)

## 📚 Introduction

A comprehensive analysis was conducted on housing data from King County, Washington, alongside an evaluation of data warehousing concepts. The dataset, obtained from Kaggle, contains house sales data from May 2014 to May 2015, consisting of 21 attributes related to various property characteristics. 

To facilitate effective analysis, the dataset was reduced to 3250 observations using RStudio, while maintaining all original attributes. Additionally, 2% of the data was intentionally modified to include missing values for the purpose of demonstrating data handling techniques. 

The study further explores data warehousing principles through a case study on Landbay, a UK-based mortgage lending platform, assessing its data pipeline based on scalability, data integration, governance, flexibility, and cost efficiency.
